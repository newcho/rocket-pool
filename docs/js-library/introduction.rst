Introduction
************

The Rocket Pool JavaScript library is the primary means of interaction with the Rocket Pool network for users and applications.
It is used by applications such as the `Rocket Pool website <https://www.rocketpool.net/>`_ to retrieve information about the network and facilitate user interaction.
It provides wrapper methods which load the Rocket Pool contracts with `web3.js <https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/>`_ and abstractions to use many of their features easily.

This guide assumes familiarity with JavaScript and provides all code samples as JS.
