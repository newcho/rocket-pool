Overview
********

Nodes are the workhorses of the Rocket Pool network.
Anyone can register as a node with Rocket Pool, and begin staking.
When a node operator wants to stake, they deposit 16 ETH into Rocket Pool, which is matched with 16 ETH of user deposits.
The node performs all of the validation duties required by the Ethereum network, and earns a percentage of the users' rewards as compensation.

Nodes constantly check in with the network to indicate that they are doing their job.
If a node fails to check in for a long time, it will be deactivated by other nodes.
This won't prevent it from validating (in case it still is), but will stop users from being assigned to any new minipools it creates.
