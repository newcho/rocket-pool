Staking
*******

Staking is not unique to Rocket Pool, it's a feature coming to `Ethereum 2.0 <https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/proof-of-stake/>`_ in the near future.
Ethereum 2.0 will include a new chain called the Beacon Chain, which anyone can become a validator on by making a deposit (or "stake") of ether.
Validators are responsible for ensuring the integrity of the Ethereum network, and earn interest on their deposit by doing so.

The Beacon Chain will require a large sum of ether in order to become a validator, which many may not have access to.
Rocket Pool aims to solve this problem by combining small amounts of ether from multiple users so that they can stake together!
