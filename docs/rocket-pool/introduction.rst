What does Rocket Pool do?
*************************

Rocket Pool has several objectives within the Ethereum landscape, each relevant to a different audience. It aims to:

#. Provide a network of decentralised nodes to perform proof of stake validation services for the Ethereum network;
#. Allow users who don't possess the minimum Ether required to become a validator, or the necessary technical skills to run a validation node, to participate in staking and earn rewards;
#. Allow users and businesses to run a validation node in the Rocket Pool network to earn rewards and additional income; and
#. Provide third party businesses with seamless staking services for their users via the Rocket Pool partner API.
