What does Rocket Pool do?
*************************

Rocket Pool is a first-of-its-kind decentralised staking network for Ethereum.
An excellent guide to Rocket Pool for new users can be found in our `FAQ article <https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-101-faq-ee683af10da9>`_.

It has several objectives within the Ethereum landscape, each relevant to a different audience. It aims to:

#. Provide a network of decentralised nodes to perform proof of stake validation services for the Ethereum network;
#. Allow users who don't possess the minimum ether to become a validator - or the necessary technical skills to run a node - to participate in staking and earn rewards;
#. Allow users and businesses to run validator nodes for Eth 2.0 with only 16 ETH, to earn rewards and additional income;
#. Provide any third party businesses with seamless staking services for their users.
