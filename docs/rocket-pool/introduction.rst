What does Rocket Pool do?
*************************

Rocket Pool has several objectives within the Ethereum landscape, each relevant to a different audience. It aims to:

#. provide a network of nodes to perform validation services for the Ethereum network;
#. allow users who don't possess the minimum Ether required to become a validator, or the necessary technical skills to run a validation node, to participate in staking and earn interest;
#. allow users and businesses to run a validation node in the Rocket Pool network to earn interest and additional income; and
#. provide third party businesses with seamless staking services for their users via the Rocket Pool partner API.
