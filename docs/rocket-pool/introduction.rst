What does Rocket Pool do?
*************************

Rocket Pool is a first of its kind decentralised staking network for Ethereum. An excellent guide to Rocket Pool for new users can be found in our FAQ 101 guide here https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-101-faq-ee683af10da9

It has several objectives within the Ethereum landscape, each relevant to a different audience. It aims to:

#. Provide a network of decentralised nodes to perform proof of stake validation services for the Ethereum network;
#. Allow users who don't possess the minimum Ether required to become a validator, or the necessary technical skills to run a validation node, to participate in staking and earn rewards;
#. Allow users and businesses to run a validation node for ETH2 with only 16 ETH in the Rocket Pool network to earn rewards and additional income;
#. Provide any third party businesses with seamless staking services for their users via the free to access and use Rocket Pool API.
